The home location register stores information ranging from phone numbers to current location of the subscriber. Some data contained in the home location register include the mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) which is a list of the telephone numbers used by the subscriber and the <a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/imsi">International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)</a> which is a unique identifier of each subscriber identity module (SIM) and is the primary key for each HLR record of each subscriber.</p><p class="">Cell phones and their corresponding SIMs are mostly on the move. The HLR is used to identify their last known location. This information is updated each time the device is transferred in to another location. The HLR also facilitates Short message services (SMS) by scanning through the HLR to identify the <a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/mobile-switching-center">mobile switching center (MSC)</a> currently used by the receiving party. If the recipient is reported as not available by the receiving MSC, a message waiting flag is sent on the HLR.

In half duplex, there is a two-way communication between the sender and the receiver. The sender and the receiver can both receive and send messages. The transmission between communicating parties can only be done one after the other. That is, once one end is transmitting, the other hand has to wait for the transmission to be completed before initiating a transmission. This type of communication system is used in situation where communication in both directions at the same time is not necessary. A typical example of a half-duplex communication system is a walkie talkie. A walkie talkie enables users to communicate back and forth on a specific radio frequency. However, since a walkie talkie function in half-duplex mode, only one person can speak at a time.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>5G</title><category>Network Generations</category><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 05:44:03 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/5g</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:627a8b5ac972db44a2d6384a:627b4ce44547e700d1cf46cf</guid><description><![CDATA[5G is the 5th generation mobile network.

Firewall can be implemented as a hardware or a software or a combination of both. Firewall is usually categorized as network-based firewall and host-based firewall.</p><p class="">Network based firewall is usually implemented at the edge between a local network and the internet. They are software applications running on networking devices or hardware-based firewall appliances. Network firewall filters all traffic coming in and going out of a network and allows only packets that match the pre-defined rules. Network based firewall can be stateful or stateless.</p><p class="">Host- based firewalls run on host devices as a daemon or service or an endpoint security agent and filters traffic in and out of the device. Traffic in host-based firewalls is filtered based on processes carried out, unlike network-based firewall that filters based on ports.

Other types of cells include Pico cells which are normally used to cover a small area like buildings or blind spots of bigger cells, selective cells, which are a 360-degree coverage cell and umbrella cells used to cushion the effect of hand overs between micro cells.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 17:43:07 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/dynamic-host-configuration-protocol</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:627a8b5ac972db44a2d6384a:627aa41cd4313114fc1eac67</guid><description><![CDATA[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol

A DHCP server enables host devices to request IP addresses and other networking parameters automatically. This eliminates the need for the network administrator or the user to manually input networking parameters on connected host devices to establish communication.</p><p class="">Devices communicate within and across a network using the internet protocol. A DHCP server can manage the allocation of these IP addresses on a local network. DHCP operates based on a client-sever model. When a host device connects to a network, the DHCP client sends a broadcast requesting an IP allocation (lease). The DHCP server then replies with network configuration parameters as well as a time frame for the lease of the address as predefined by the administrator. In large and complex networks, a DHCP relay can be configured to manage DHCP client and server request across subnets. DHCP can be implemented on IPv4 and IPv6 and is defined by RFC 2131.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ethernet</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 17:42:23 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/ethernet</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:627a8b5ac972db44a2d6384a:627aa3f778a85f5a7a44036d</guid><description><![CDATA[Ethernet is the most common type of Local Area Network (LAN) Connection in

Ethernet connects devices on a wired LAN, enabling them to communicate with each other using a common protocol. An Ethernet cable is the physical wiring connected to communicating devices, over which data frames can be transmitted. Ethernet was introduced in 1980 and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defined Ethernet standard as 802.3 in 1983. Over time, Ethernet made obsolete other competing wired LAN technology like Token ring designed by IBM, FDDI and ARCNET. As at the year 2010, the Ethernet equipment market was estimated at $16 billion per year.</p><p class="">Compared to the wireless local area network (WLAN), the ethernet is essentially faster, providing speed from 10mbps – which is the original data rate – to newer versions of Ethernet (Fast Ethernet) which supports data transfer rate of up to 100mbps, a further development introduced Gigabit Ethernet which has a transmission rate between 1Gbps to 10Gbps based on the evolving Ethernet cable technology implemented (cat5, cat5e or cat6). Ethernet is less vulnerable to disruption.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Encryption</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 17:41:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/encryption</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:627a8b5ac972db44a2d6384a:627aa3b9d54f7f1f45f85281</guid><description><![CDATA[Encryption is the method of encoding information.

In encryption, plain text – which is the actual representation of the information – is passed through an algorithm to produce a ciphertext – which is an alternative form of the actual information. Encryption ensures that only authorized parties can decipher the ciphertext to recreate the plain text. The process of encrypting and decrypting information is known as cryptography. Encryption uses an algorithm or a cipher which includes a variable. This variable (Key) is what makes the cipher unique. A combination of knowing the algorithm used and the key used as a variable is what makes encryption such a valuable security tool.</p><p class="">Encryption has long been implemented by the military for secure communication. It is also being used to secure data in transit on a network. There are two types of encryption. Symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.</p><p class="">In symmetric encryption, the encryption and decryption keys are the same. This key is shared between communicating parties. The weak point of this encryption is the transfer of keys between the parties involved. This encryption is best used for one-to-one sharing.</p><p class="">Asymmetric encryption (public key encryption), is a type of encryption where the encryption key is published and can be viewed by everyone but the decryption key is private and can only be accessed by the recipient.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Frequency</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 17:40:36 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/frequency</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:627a8b5ac972db44a2d6384a:627aa386d5d35c3a929744a7</guid><description><![CDATA[Frequency is defined as the number of cycles per unit time.

Frequency is usually used to represent short and fast waves like sound and radio signals. Frequency is measured in Hertz in recognition of a German scholar Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. Hertz (Hz) is the number of occurrences of an event per second. If it takes ½ second for a total occurrence of an event, then the frequency is said to be 2Hz. 1 thousand Hz is represented as 1 kilohertz (1 KHz) 1 million hertz is 1 megahertz (1 MHz) and 1 billion hertz is 1 gigahertz (1 GHz). Frequency is usually represented by <em>f </em>and the Greek letters nu (ν) – often used to specify electromagnetic waves like light – and omega (ω) – used to define angular frequency (which is how many revolutions occur in radian per unit time).</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
