It refers to lightweight vehicles, such as a scooter or electric bicycle. Micromobile vehicles use roads, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks to travel at limited speeds and carry passengers over short distances. Vehicles are often shared via a smartphone app and can be picked up at docking stations or at random places in cities. To maintain some control, the vehicles often operate only within certain geographic boundaries. A micromobility journey can often involve multiple ways of transport. Someone can leave the subway station, pull out their smartphones, rent a nearby electric bicycle, and drive the last few blocks to the office. In the afternoon, take a scooter standing in front of the building to get to a meeting quickly.</p><h2>The market of micromobility</h2><p class="">The market of micromobility has seen a quick rise after the concept of transportation has been widely adopted by pioneering services like Uber. Another driver in the market is the wide availability of lightweight electric vehicles like scooters and e-bikes. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide and had a severe impact on micromobility. While lockdown measures and quarantine orders helped contain the coronavirus, they have also changed the need for mobility. Amid a new reality of working from home, canceling trips, and even forgoing outings to restaurants and grocery stores, the micromobility industry—encompassing a range of lightweight vehicles such as bicycles, scooters, and mopeds—is facing devastating declines in ridership and revenue. The blow to micromobility came just as the market was taking off. With the COVID restrictions easing around the world, McKinsey predicts the micromobility industry would be a $300 billion to $500 billion markets by 2030.</p><h2><br>What are the different types of micromobility vehicles?</h2><p class="">We already named a few types of micromobility vehicles, but to understand the dynamic micromobility market it’s key to understand the different vehicle types. Each type tailors to a specific need in the urban environment. Let’s have a look at the different types.</p><p class=""><strong>Electric scooter&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">Electric scooters (scooters) started popping up in many cities around the world and are one of the vehicle types that have created the micromobility category. These vehicles are certainly the most popular in the world. In the US, there are easily over a hundred thousand of these shared scooters on the street. The electric scooter is a standing scooter with a footboard, two wheels, and a handlebar with acceleration, steering, and braking functions. They typically travel at speeds of 18–28 mph / 24–32 km/h and can drive on bicycle lanes or sidewalks. Most e-scooters operate via a sharing app that allows users to rent the scooter by the minute. Riders download the app on their smartphone, set up their payment details and find the nearest scooter. The benefit for the riders is that after using the scooter, they can just park it and leave it there for the next rider.</p><p class=""><strong>Electric bicycles (e-bikes)&nbsp;</strong></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">An electric bicycle (e-bike) looks like any other traditional bicycle. The electrical components, such as batteries, motors, and controllers, are hidden in the bike. The operation is like riding a regular bicycle. Pedaling, steering, and braking are the same and will feel familiar to experienced cyclists. What makes this vehicle type popular in cities around the world is its help in pedaling. Whether you are climbing steep uphills or facing strong headwinds. The rider pedals on his own, but the efforts are enhanced with the help of the electric motor. Some e-bikes can also operate on the electric mode to power the bike without pedaling. Like the e-scooter, the maximum speed of the e-bike is around 18–28 mph / 24–32 km/h. This keeps the vehicle in the same class as a regular bike and allows you to ride in the designated bike lane. Since bike-share has been around in some cities for quite some time, you see there are two models. Some electric bike-sharing companies use dockless bike models. This allows the rider to leave the bike anywhere when they are finished riding. Another system that helps cities not to overcrowd sidewalks with bikes is the docking system. It requires riders to return the bike at a designated dock station. These docking stations are in a densely populated area around the city.</p><p class=""><strong>Electric skateboards (skateboards)&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">Like e-scooters and e-bikes, the skateboard is similar to its traditional counterpart, but with some additional electronic components. A typical skateboard includes a battery and an electric motor, allowing riders to cruise at higher speeds. Skateboards are compact and portable skateboards but these are very difficult to use for a sharing model. Skateboards are often used as personal micromobility options to cover the last mile of a journey per train or subway.</p><p class=""><strong>Electric mini-cars&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">In some countries in Europe, there are also sharing programs that use tiny electric cars that operate at a speed of around 28 mph / 45 km/h. These can be used on the road in an urban environment and are comfortable for riders when it’s raining.<br><br>So all in all, lightweight and mainly used for single-seater vehicles (bicycles, scooters, and everything mentioned above) to transport short distances.</p>

  <h2>Micromobility and IoT</h2><p class=""><br>The Internet of Things is about connecting physical objects to the internet. Something most consumers will associate with smart home appliances. But the possibility of connecting lightweight vehicles to the internet-enabled micromobility. The popularity and benefits come from sharing these vehicles in an urban environment. The only way to know where the closest vehicle is by sharing its GPS location with the app. In order to do so, it uses the cellular network to communicate this to the app.</p><p class="">Another key element is to unlock the vehicle via the app. When the rider presses unlock, it sends this message via the internet to the sharing platform. The platform has to relay the message via the mobile network to the vehicle to unlock the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Simbase helps micromobility by providing secure access to and from the vehicles with the most flexible connectivity option in the market. eScooters can get lost during their lifetime and the ability to stop the cost for cellular connectivity is a must for micromobility operators to keep costs under control.</p><h2>The benefits of micromobility</h2><p class="">Riding a scooter is fun of and by itself, but micromobility offers key benefits for users and cities alike. ‍</p><p class=""><strong>Low Cost</strong></p><p class="">Micromobility vehicles have a lower cost to manufacture and run on electricity. Dozens of electric scooters or e-bikes can be purchased for the price of a single electric car. These small vehicles require less energy and save cities’ parking space.‍</p><p class=""><strong>Sustainable&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">Micromobility vehicles are a means to a more sustainable way of transportation. They do not depend on fossil fuels. It would be great if these vehicles are charged with 100% sustainable electricity. Cities can play a key role in making sure these vehicles are charged with renewable energy at times the grid can supply this.</p><h2>Future of micromobility</h2><p class="">As a current innovation, Micromobility as a Service aims to integrate dockless electric bicycles and scooters into the city. This dockless vehicle technology uses IoT-powered GPS trackers and sensors. With the help of this technology and apps on their devices, people can find parking spaces. Also, charging stations and sometimes even reserved parking spaces. It also displays indicators such as distance traveled, nearest charging station, estimated time to complete the trip, and cost of the trip. This information is also important for micromobility operators to further upgrade. It’s also useful to change their software and hardware to provide the best service to their users. Some of the industry’s leading companies are working on developing micromobility services infrastructure platforms. These platforms should provide a network of charging stations, docks, and service stations for electric bicycles and scooters. So the future for this micromobility technology is bright because it’s a lot to do that this could be every person’s casualty.</p><p class="">The Internet of Things has touched many industries already. But with micromobility, it has been an absolute game-changer. The added abilities to share the vehicles via a smartphone have been crucial in adapting it as a convened way of moving around cities and helping navigate busy urban traffic. Traffic will increase as more people adopt technology and more people move to cities for employment. The role of micromobility will therefore expand as cities incorporate micromobility as a part of the transportation policy. IoT will continue to contribute to cities becoming smarter and reducing the daily commute.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d/1651582009681-X783MNANP52XO7RFFO6D/unsplash-image-3ZzOF5qqiEA.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1057"><media:title type="plain">The future of micromobility</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>What Is ICCID And Why Does It Matter?</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 12:41:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/blog/what-is-iccid-and-why-does-it-matter</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:6270fbf90c5fff3327c94754:6271226e34091f5ef83d2829</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Did you know that there are more active SIM cards than the number of people in this world?

  <h2>Why ICCID Matters: Importance And Applications?</h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The ICCID number plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient, secure, and accurate management of mobile services.</span></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>Network Registration:</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> The ICCID is primarily used to register a SIM card with the network provider. The network provider checks the ICCID, allowing it to identify the SIM card issuer and subscriber's account information.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>Security:</strong> </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Because every ICCID is unique, it provides a level of security by preventing unauthorized access to the network. If a SIM card is lost or stolen, the network provider can use the ICCID to block network access for that particular SIM.</span></p></li><li><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>User Management:</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> The ICCID also helps network providers manage their subscribers. Providers can track usage, manage accounts, and provide appropriate services.</span></p></li><li><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>Device Activation:</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> In some cases, the ICCID number is used during the activation of a new phone or tablet. This allows the device to connect to the correct network and set up services specific to the user.</span></p></li><li><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>Roaming Services:</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> When a user travels internationally and their mobile device roams on a foreign network, the ICCID helps in identifying the home network of the user.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ul><h2>Is ICCID The Same As SIM? Differentiating Between The Two</h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">While the ICCID and SIM card are closely related, they are not the same thing. Here's how:</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">A </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>SIM card</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">, which stands for Subscriber Identity Module, is a physical microchip that connects your device, such as a smartphone or tablet, to a cellular network. It holds personal data like your phone number, security data, and more, allowing you to make calls, send messages, and use mobile data.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>ICCID</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> is the identifier for the SIM card itself. It's a unique series of numbers assigned to each SIM card, which is both printed on the card and stored within it. This identifier is used by your mobile network provider to recognize your SIM card and grant access to the network.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">If we draw a parallel to a concert scenario, the SIM card is like your concert ticket, while the ICCID is the unique ticket number printed on it. The ticket (SIM card) gets you into the concert (the mobile network), while the ticket number (ICCID) is used by the organizers (network providers) to confirm that your ticket is valid.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">So, while they are interconnected, they serve different but complementary roles in mobile communications.</span></p><h3>ICCID Vs IMSI</h3><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">An Integrated Circuit Card Identification (ICCID ) number is not the same as an IMSI. Although both are a part of the SIM profile, the IMSI identifies the subscriber, and the ICCID identifies the SIM card. IMSI plays a crucial role when connecting to the networks, as it holds the information on what providers you are allowed to connect to. Your service provider keeps details about your SIM in a so-called </span><a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/home-location-register-hlr" target="_blank"><span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">Home Location register</span></span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">If you are in a different country, away from the local service provider with your roaming settings enabled, you can connect to a different service provider. Based on the IMSI this cellular service provider allows you on their network or not. This is done by the roaming network to check the</span><a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/visitor-location-register" target="_blank"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">Visitor Location register</span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> for what is allowed for this SIM.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">While there can only be one ICCID on one SIM card, that same SIM card can have multiple IMSIs. Such SIM cards are called Multi-IMSI SIM cards. To learn more about that, you can check out this guide about </span><a href="https://www.simbase.com/learning/what-is-multi-imsi" target="_blank"><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">Multi-IMSI cards</span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">.</span></p><h3>Where Is The ICCID Number On A SIM Card?</h3><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The ICCID number is typically printed on the body of the SIM card itself. The longest sequence with 19-20 digits is the ICCID number. It is often printed on the larger card from which you pop out the actual size SIM.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">You can also find the ICCID number within the settings of your device. The exact path will depend on the device and operating system, but it's generally under the 'About Phone' or 'About Device' section in the settings.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Simbase SIMs, just like many other SIM cards, have their ICCID number on the back of the SIM card. But with many IoT devices, the plastic is tossed after installation. That’s why at Simbase we added it on the backside of the SIM chip as well.</span><br></p><h2>Decoding ICCID Numbers: How To Interpret And Understand Them</h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Here is the detailed ICCID decoder with the format: <strong>MMCC IINN NNNN NNNN NN C x</strong></span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>MM</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> - a constant number 89, because that is the international ISO 7812 standard assigned to Telecom.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>CC</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> - country code, also known as </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>MCC</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> (Mobile Country Code) is used in wireless telephone networks to identify a mobile subscriber's country of origin. It can also be 3 digits number.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>II</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> - SIM card issuer identifier, also known as </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>MNC</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> (Mobile Network Code) is used to identify a specific mobile network provider. If your device roams in another country, it must connect to a local network, and the MNC allows it to identify itself to the new network. In today’s world of many partnerships between cellular companies and service providers, you might find that your SIM’s MNC shows a partner company, rather than the one you bought the SIM from. It can also be a 3 digits number.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>N</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">’s - letters N represent a SIM number, also known as an account ID. While all the numbers before N can be used by many SIM cards, the SIM number is what makes the SIM card unique.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>C</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> - checksum calculated from the previous digits using the Luhn algorithm.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"><strong>x</strong></span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> - extra digit that ICCID officially does not list as part of the number.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">As you can see, once broken down, the code holds some valuable information which in turn allows for better identification of a SIM card.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Most SIMs contain either 19 or 20 digits, but as there are more and more SIM cards being manufactured, the ICCID length was increased.</span></p>


























  <h2>Conclusion</h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">In the era of digitization, understanding the intricacies of mobile network identifiers like the ICCID number becomes vital. Whether it's to secure your network, manage your mobile services, or enhance your connectivity, the ICCID plays an indispensable role.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">For businesses operating in the Internet of Things (IoT) space, the ICCID becomes even more critical. Reliable connectivity forms the backbone of IoT deployments, making the choice of SIM cards incredibly important.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Simbase offers IoT SIM cards designed for reliability, security, and seamless international connectivity.

What is the difference?</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 13:31:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/blog/wi-fi-vs-cellular-data-what-is-the-difference</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:6270fbf90c5fff3327c94754:627120bd27c705095dd71801</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Technology is constantly evolving, which means that the way we use it changes as well. Years ago, people were using Wi-Fi for all their internet needs. Nowadays, cellular data has become a popular choice. Why? And how do you know which one to choose when? This article will outline the difference between Wi-Fi and cellular data.</p><h2>What is Wi-Fi?</h2><p class="">Wi-Fi is a wireless connection that allows you to use the internet without connecting through a wired network, such as with an Ethernet cable. It usually requires you to be in the vicinity of the Wi-Fi signal, which means you need to be within a certain range or connected to a network.</p><p class="">Wi-Fi networks are easy to set up and can be used at home or in public places like coffee shops and libraries. When you're on Wi-Fi, your device will automatically detect nearby networks and connect if they're open.</p><p class="">In general, Wi-Fi networks are created by one device (usually a router) and all of the users of that Wi-Fi network have their data sent through the router which is connected via the ethernet cable or wirelessly with a SIM card. For homes and offices, the most common way is the ethernet cable. It is relatively cheap and provides the best data speeds. That is because the ethernet cables, unlike cellular connections, are connected to the internet service provider via the underground cables, so it does not incur extra costs to the provider based on the amount of data you use. It is a perfect option for fixed locations that have all the infrastructure needed - houses, offices, shops, and so on.</p><h2>What is Cellular Data?</h2><p class="">Cellular data is a type of internet connection that uses cellular networks to provide service. In 2020, there were 4.28 billion unique mobile internet users, meaning that over 90% of the worldwide internet population utilized a mobile device to access the internet. It is the standard for every phone and therefore the most popular method of connectivity, and it's what you'll find on your smartphone and many IoT devices. Instead of connecting to a local network that has been created by a router or some other device, you communicate with the Internet directly. This is possible because of antennas and other hardware within the device that allows sending and receiving signals from cellular towers.</p><p class="">Because cellular network providers incur costs related to the whole cellular infrastructure, you have to pay according to the data you have used within a given month. This means that transferring a lot of data using cellular technology may be costly.<br><br>Cellular data also allows having connectivity as you move. As long as there is coverage - you can travel everywhere and still have access to the Internet, which is great!<br></p><h2>The difference between Wi-Fi and Cellular Data</h2><p class="">While most IoT devices can have multiple ways to connect to the Internet, there are two main ways - Wi-Fi or cellular data. The difference is how these connections are made. Wi-Fi connections are made by tapping into a network that already has an established connection. This means you need to be located near a router in order to get an internet connection. Cellular data, on the other hand, is accessed through the nearest cellular tower. It will provide access wherever you are. Wi-Fi will connect instantly when you come into the range of a wireless router, whereas cellular data may take up to three seconds for that same connection before it's available again after switching networks.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">All in all, Wi-Fi acts as a local hub that allows you to connect many devices to a single network. The source of connection for that network can be a cellular network or ethernet cable, whereas a cellular connection acts as a direct connection method on devices without any additional hardware such as a router.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d/1651581298646-9D4RDH3W966KE8PEMO7C/unsplash-image-exv1JefGzTU.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Wi-Fi vs Cellular Data.

These IoT gateways provide the internet connectivity required via cellular networks and offer the opportunity for devices in the local network to connect to the internet.</p><p class="">IoT gateways are used to transfer data from IoT sensors and controllers to and from the cloud. For example, you can connect a simple temperature sensor to the IoT gateway to send its measurements to the cloud immediately, instead of storing this data on a local device.</p><p class="">By using IoT gateways, companies can also connect devices that are not easily connected to the internet, such as Bluetooth devices. The gateways also eliminate the need for companies and organizations to gather and manage data and devices locally.</p><h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">What are the components of the IoT gateway?</span></h2><p class="">The components of the IoT gateway obviously differ depending on the specific use-case. An IoT Gateway is a small computer that serves as the edge server. Since it creates a local internet network, just as your router does at home or at the office, it also functions as an internet router. This provides the functionality to route internet traffic from and to the connected devices. The cellular module, in case of a cellular router, provides internet access via the mobile network. Usually IoT gateways provide both internet via cellular, and fixed line internet through the ethernet port on the device.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Depending on the different type of gateway, it can connect other devices via a host of different options.</p><h3>Ethernet</h3><p class="">One of the more straightforward devices that can be connected to an IoT gateway is anything that has an ethernet port already. This can be a wide range of different devices, like industrial PCs or IP cameras.</p><h3>Inputs/outputs</h3><p class="">Many sensors can connect to an IoT gateway using the I/O ports. These can be both digital or analog sensors. The IoT Gateway can transform the input of the sensors into bytes that can be sent to the cloud for further processing.</p><h3>Wireless</h3><p class="">An IoT Gateway can also connect wireless sensors that can’t communicate on the internet directly. A good example in IoT are bluetooth sensors. The gateway allows these local sensors to send data via bluetooth to the gateway and the gateway can forward the data to the application.</p><h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">Creating own IoT gateway</span></h2><p class="">You might decide to create your own IoT gateway and for that, you will need some sort of device like a router or computer - something that can communicate with the internet. Besides that, you need software that allows transforming data and adding logic to the setup. One option is to use Node-red, which is a web server and IoT server combined. This can be installed on a development board like a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Node-red is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, servers, and online services in new and interesting ways. This open-source software built on Node.js doesn’t get in your way but provides the essential tools to do the job effectively.</p><h3>IoT gateway security</h3><p class="">IoT gateways can be vulnerable to several attacks. These attacks include denial of service, man-in-the-middle, and others. These attacks can have severe consequences that could cause serious issues, including data loss and network outages. A secure IoT gateway should prevent the damage that these attacks could do if they occur and should be able to quickly detect and stop them when they occur.</p><p class="">The first step for securing the IoT gateway is to ensure that it has the most secure operating system possible. By making sure that the operating system is secure, it will be better able to prevent attacks from occurring and be able to detect and stop them if they occur. The next step is to secure any network traffic between the IoT gateway and the rest of the network. This should include using strong encryption, as well as having routers or firewalls on either end of the connection.</p><p class="">It’s also important to deploy all appropriate monitoring tools on IoT gateways. This can help protect the network and warn of any issues that could cause a system crash or other type of problem that could affect the operation or security of the system.</p><h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">IoT Gateways are great for many IoT use-cases</span></h2><p class="">IoT gateways are important enablers for many IoT use-case. They can serve as the internet gateway for otherwise local devices. With IoT gateway technology becoming more advanced, new functionality will be created that can change how your team and business works. As companies invest in technologies to make the best use of corresponding mobile features, the importance of IoT gateways will only increase.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d/1651580860122-5H5YNAL5DAQAVDFF7V9T/unsplash-image--7RXjpd_XKw.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="844"><media:title type="plain">What are IoT Gateways?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>What is IIoT, or the Industrial Internet of Things?</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 12:21:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/blog/what-is-iiot-or-the-industrial-internet-of-things</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:6270fbf90c5fff3327c94754:62711023fb664f5680c866b8</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT)</p><p class="">In the current scenario, the world is becoming more and more connected. With the use of new technologies like machine learning and AI, we can make this process even faster and easier. One effective way to do so is with an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).&nbsp;</p><h3>What is the Industrial Internet of Things?</h3><p class="">Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the integration of Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT). IIOT is also referred to as the Industrial Internet. It's a term that describes how new technologies are connecting industries with machines, data, and people in order to create new opportunities for efficiency and growth. The Industrial Internet of Things is a concept where factories, warehouses, and supply chains are digitally connected to one another. Data from these devices is then sent over the internet to be processed and analyzed. This helps organizations to improve processes, reduce waste, and create more innovative products.</p><h2>The Difference Between IIoT and IoT</h2><p class="">The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the extension of the Internet to the industrial space. The result is an automated, data-driven system that can monitor everything from machinery to operations to energy usage. IIoT doesn't just monitor, it also optimizes manufacturing processes and makes them smarter by providing information about what's happening right now. The result is an automatic control system that can be used in numerous industries such as manufacturing, retailing, construction, etc.</p><p class="">For example, you might have a process that requires constant monitoring and reporting to ensure it continues to run efficiently. You could use the Automatic Control System to send out periodic reports on the status of your process and make changes in real-time.</p><h3>Advantages of IIOT</h3><p class="">With IIoT, users are able to make smarter decisions about their machinery. For example, manufacturers of wind turbines can monitor data like wind speed and electrical output of the turbine, improving processes at their factories and saving money.</p><p class="">The benefits of this technology are as follows:</p><p class="">- Increased visibility into manufacturing processes</p><p class="">- Improved reliability by providing early warnings on potential failures</p><p class="">- Optimized maintenance schedules</p><p class="">- Reduced human error from manual data entry or calculations</p><h3>IIoT Future</h3><p class="">The future IIoT environment will be composed of the following three tiers:</p><p class="">Tier 1 - Process data from production equipment using sensors, machine-to-machine communications networks, and data analytics to generate operational insights.</p><p class="">Tier 2 - Integrate these insights into enterprise IT systems that provide decision-support services for key business functions such as sales forecasting or inventory management.</p><p class="">Tier 3 - Incorporate predictive analytics into production operations with technologies that automate control processes without manual intervention.</p><h3>IIoT is just starting</h3><p class="">With the NB-IoT and LTE-M technologies still rolling out in different countries, IIoT and IoT, in general, are just starting to gain traction and it will inevitably be used more frequently. As automation becomes more technologically advanced, any data that would be required to collect manually will be done using IoT devices. This, in turn, will allow manufacturers and other companies to collect a lot of data which will allow them to improve their product quality and costs. Because of this, it will be beneficial for everyone involved - from consumers to manufacturers.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d/1651576988617-ZRJVOB87LCJN8VQID18X/unsplash-image-jHZ70nRk7Ns.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">What is IIoT, or the Industrial Internet of Things?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Explore the Different Types of SIM Cards: A Comprehensive Guide</title><dc:creator>Roel van der Meer</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 11:14:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.simbase.com/blog/guide-to-sim-factors</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6267c7fbad6356776aa08e6d:6270fbf90c5fff3327c94754:6270ff05bfb0804d870c1ee7</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Did you know that there are over </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/245501/multiple-mobile-device-ownership-worldwide/" target="_blank"><span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">15 billion mobile connections</span></span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> worldwide? Each one relies on a tiny but mighty piece of technology — the SIM card. <br>Since the early '90s, SIM cards have been silently powering our mobile communication. Yet, they've morphed dramatically since their credit-card-sized debut, reflecting our unrelenting pursuit of technological miniaturization and advancement.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">SIM cards have come a long way from enabling the first generation of mobile phones to now empowering the expansive</span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent"> Internet of Things</span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> (IoT). In this article, we delve into the different types of SIM cards — from the Full-Size SIM to the Nano SIM, and the high-tech eSIM. By the end, you'll know which SIM size or type you need for your IoT device.</span></p><h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">SIM Cards</span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">: What They Are and How They Work</span></h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">A SIM card, or Subscriber Identity Module, is a small smart card that connects your mobile device to a specific cellular network. Its main purpose is to store the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number and its related keys, which are used to identify and authenticate the user of a mobile network.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">When your mobile device is powered on, it reads data from the SIM card and passes it to the mobile network. This process allows the network to verify the user’s identity and determine whether they have access to the network.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">If you travel outside the coverage area of the original network (known as roaming), the SIM card can connect to a different network. This is possible only if the original network has a roaming agreement with the foreign network. This is what enables you to use your mobile devices when traveling internationally.</span></p><h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Different Types of SIM Cards</span></h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Here are the major 6 types of SIM cards:</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">1. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Full-Size SIM Cards (1FF)</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Full-Size SIM cards, or 1FF (First Form Factor), are the original SIM cards introduced in the early 90s. They were called “credit-card size” or “bar-card” cards because of their shape and size, measuring 85.6 x 53.98 mm.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">1FFs were used in the bulky first portable phones that supported a 2G network. They were able to identify the user to the network, store their unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number, and facilitate connection with the mobile network. Nowadays, no one makes devices that accept 1FF SIM cards.</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">2. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Mini SIM Cards (2FF)</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">A credit card-sized SIM card is uncomfortable and requires a lot of space within the device. Hence, mobile devices became smaller and more compact leading to the invention of smaller SIM cards. Introduced in 1996, 2FF SIM cards used to be the most common type of SIM card in the market for many years.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Despite the reduction in physical size, the Mini SIM continued to carry the same functionality as the Full-Size SIM, holding crucial user identification and network information. They measure 12 x 15 mm and are mainly used with </span><a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/gsm" target="_blank"><span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">GSM</span></span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> devices. In addition to mobile phones, you can also find them in IoT devices.</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">3. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Micro SIM Cards (3FF)</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The advent of smartphones and the drive to make them even smaller led to the creation of the Micro SIM, or 3FF (Third Form Factor). Introduced in 2003, it was created to replace the 2FF SIM cards which were taking up too much precious device internal space.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">At 15 x 12mm, the Micro SIM is significantly smaller than the Mini SIM but still performs the same tasks - it holds the IMSI and authenticates the user with the network. It was one of the most common sizes used in older smartphones and it is still being used in some of the newer devices.</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">4. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Nano SIM Cards (4FF)</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Introduced in 2012, the 4FF SIM card is the smallest of the standard SIMs. Measuring just 12.3 x 8 mm, it contains almost no plastic around the chip. It is really small and compact making it perfect for smart wearable devices and the latest smartphones.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The Nano SIM is currently the smallest physical SIM card used in mobile devices. And yet manufacturers are striving to make devices thinner and save space for other components. Despite its small size, it contains all the functionality of its predecessors.</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">5. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Embedded SIM (MFF2)/eSIM</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Unlike traditional SIM cards that need to be inserted into a device, </span><a href="https://www.simbase.com/iot-glossary-dictionary/embedded-sim" target="_blank"><span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">eSIMs</span></span></a><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black"> are embedded and soldered into the device during manufacturing. Measuring just 6 x 5 mm, they are significantly smaller than even Nano SIMs. Also called MFF2, they are often used for IoT (Internet of Things) devices that require more flexibility.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Newer IoT devices use embedded SIM cards as they are smaller and more secure since they cannot be removed. Some new smartphones also come with an embedded SIM along with a traditional SIM slot allowing the user to choose.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The beauty of eSIMs is that they can be reprogrammed to connect with different networks, eliminating the need for physical SIM swaps to change carriers. This allows you to switch between networks over the air. eSIMs are increasingly found in newer models of smartphones, smartwatches, laptops, and IoT devices.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span class="sqsrte-text-color--darkAccent">6. </span><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Integrated SIM</span></h4><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">The Integrated SIM, or iSIM is an advanced variant of the eSIM. While the eSIM is a separate chip embedded in the device, iSIM is incorporated into the device’s hardware. It's permanently integrated into the device making it highly robust and resistant to physical wear and tear. These SIMs are particularly suited to industrial applications, such as IoT devices, connected cars, and smart city infrastructures, where physical SIM card changes are impractical.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">All the SIM card needs is just the chip, and the plastic around it wastes space that manufacturers could use to improve and optimize their devices.&nbsp;</span></p>


























  <h2><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Simbase - The Right SIM Card Type for IoT Device</span></h2><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">Choosing the correct SIM for an IoT device hinges on device design, environment, scalability, cost efficiency, and network coverage. Compact designs favor Nano SIMs, but eSIMs and integrated SIMs are becoming standard for their flexibility and minimal space requirements. However, not all IoT devices come with eSIMs or iSIMs. They come with various SIM compatibility slots leaving you to wonder which size to choose.</span></p><p class=""><span class="sqsrte-text-color--black">But with Simbase SIM cards, you don’t really need to worry about it. Because like most SIM cards manufactured today, even Simbase SIM cards are multi-sized SIM cards. These SIM cards hold all the sizes (1FF/2FF/3FF/4FF) in one card - so you do not need to worry about getting the wrong size SIM card.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p class="">Broadly speaking, there are two main types of SIM cards: Physical SIM cards (Full-Size, Mini, Micro, and Nano SIMs) and Virtual SIM cards (eSIMs and Integrated SIMs). Physical SIM cards are removable, while Virtual SIM cards are either integrated into the device or exist solely digitally and don't require a physical card.</p>
